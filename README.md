# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project predicts **house prices** based on different parameters such as  
🏙️ *Location*, 🛏️ *Number of Bedrooms*, 🛁 *Bathrooms*, 📐 *Area Size*, and more.  

Using **Machine Learning algorithms**, it helps understand how these factors impact property prices — making it valuable for **buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals**.
