🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📖 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
Using Machine Learning algorithms, it helps understand how different factors affect property prices — useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts.

⚙️ Tech Stack

🧠 Machine Learning – Linear Regression, Random Forest
🐍 Python – pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
📊 Data Visualization – matplotlib, seaborn
📁 Dataset – House price dataset (Gurugram / your city)

🚀 Features

✅ Predict house prices based on input parameters
✅ Visualize data trends and correlations
✅ Clean and well-preprocessed dataset
✅ Easy-to-use interface (can be extended into web app)

🧩 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection – Load and inspect the dataset
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encoding, scaling
3️⃣ Model Training – Train ML models on processed data
4️⃣ Model Evaluation – Check accuracy and performance
5️⃣ Prediction – Use trained model to predict new house prices

📈 Results

💡 Achieved accurate predictions with optimized model performance.
Graphs and feature importance show key factors influencing house prices.

📦 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

🌟 Future Improvements

🔹 Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
🔹 Add real-time data via APIs
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM)
